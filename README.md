php-crunchbase-scraper
================

A spider written in PHP to scrape Crunchbase for company name, twitter handle and full profile URL from a category key word.


# Usage #

Set the $category variable to tage from the Crunchbase website.

Here's an example: http://www.crunchbase.com/tag/cloud-computing


# Warning! #

Be careful about spidering too many results as Crunchbase may ban you so it is better to use niche search terms.
